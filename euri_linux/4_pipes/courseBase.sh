used primarily by radio amateurs to transmit and receive static, black-and-white images.

A technical term for SSTV is "narrowband television". Analogue terrestrial
analogue terrestrial television broadcasting in AM, generally requires a 6 MHz channel (NTSC, NTSC, NTSC-AC, NTSC-AC, NTSC-AC).
of 6 MHz (NTSC, 30 fps) or 5.5 MHz (PAL or SECAM, 25 fps), but SSTV typically only uses a maximum of 3 kHz (NTSC, 30 fps) or 5.5 MHz (PAL or SECAM, 25 fps).
only uses a maximum of 3 kHz bandwidth. It is a much slower method of
transmission of pictures as it normally takes between about eight seconds to a couple of minutes to transmit a single frame.
a couple of minutes to transmit a picture frame.

SSTV is transmitted using Single Side Band, SSB (SSB), although any other modulation can be used as a modulation, such as
any other modulation such as FM or AM can be used.
Since SSTV systems operate on voice frequencies, radio amateurs use SSTV on the shortwave bands.
this system on the shortwave (also known as HF) bands. On VHF (144 MHz )
and UHF (432 MHz ).

In Citizens Band, the USB mode is used on the 27.700 MHz frequency" > sstv
