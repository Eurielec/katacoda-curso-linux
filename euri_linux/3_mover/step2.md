To create directories we have `mkdir`.

To create a `mydir` directory in the current directory:

`mkdir mydir`{{ execute }}

To create a `mydir` directory in the `/tmp` directory:

`mkdir /tmp/mydir`{{ execute }}

To create nested directories, the `-p` option is used:

`mkdir -p first/second/third`{{ execute }}
