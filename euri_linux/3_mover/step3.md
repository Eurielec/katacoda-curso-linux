**Deleting and renaming files**

`mv` Renaming a file
`rm` Delete a file
`rm -f` Force delete a file
`rm -i` Delete a file iteratively
`cp` copy a file

As we have seen we create a file with `touch unfichero`{{ execute }}
We can move it with `mv unfichero otrofichero`{{ execute }}
We can copy it with `cp otrofichero copiafich`{{ execute }}
We delete it with `rm -i otrofichero`{{ execute }}


Is it possible to move a file without using the `mv` command?
