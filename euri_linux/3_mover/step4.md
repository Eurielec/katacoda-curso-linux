**Deleting and renaming directories**

`mv` Renaming a directory
`rmdir` Delete an empty directory
`rm -rf` Force deletion of a directory recursively


As we have seen, we can create a directory with `mkdir mydir`{{ execute }}
If there is nothing inside we can delete it with `rmdir`{{ execute }}

Create a directory and create a document inside with `touch`. Try to delete the directory... Can you? what does it say?

To delete a directory that is not empty, use `rm -rf`{{rf}}.

And... on the other hand... Can you move a directory that is not empty?
