The `cd` command can be controlled in different ways:

* `pwd`{{ execute }} Displays the current directory
* `cd .`{{ execute }} Moves to the current directory, does not move
* `cd ..`{{ execute }} Moves to the directory before the current directory
* `cd -`{{ execute }} Move to the previous directory
* `cd /`{{ execute }} Move to the root directory
* `cd`{{ execute }} Moves to  `/home/tu_usuario`
* `cd âˆ¼`{{ execute }} Moves to  `/home/tu_usuario`
* `cd ~usuario33/`{{ execute }} Moves to `/home/usuario33`

*Pss*

Most Linux shells have an implicit option that autocompletes both the command name and the paths passed as arguments.

Simply pressing the **tabulator** will complete it and in the case of multiple matches, it will display them on screen waiting for more characters to be entered for further completion. **Try it!**
