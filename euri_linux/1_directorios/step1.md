By default, when logging into a shell, we will find ourselves in our home directory (/home/user), since by default the shell places us there.

To find out which path we are in, we type pwd{{execute}}.

We can also see that in Unix-based operating systems the directories are separated by the character "/" instead of the one used by Windows, "/".
