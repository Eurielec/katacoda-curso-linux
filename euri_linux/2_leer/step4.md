**To view small files**

If the file is small, use the cat command. `cat` then concatenates (concatenates) the lines of the files listed as parameters and writes them to the screen.


`cat ShoppingList`{{ execute}}

When cat has a single parameter it will output that file. This method is useful for files that fit on a single screen or window. In the case of using windows, if they have memory and a bar to see the last (scroll) lines, it can be used with slightly larger files.
