Before sending a printable file to screen or printer, we want to know its size.

`wc` tells us the size of a file by counting its lines, words and characters. The last information we could know with `ls`.


`wc foto.png sstv.ogg cripto_gpg.md`{{ execute }}

Or we can find out how many lines all the files in the folder have with `wc *`{{ execute }}
