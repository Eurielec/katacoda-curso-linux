But the `find` functions don't stop here as it gives us much more versatility since we have the `-exec` option, the interesting thing about this function is that we can execute commands for the results taken from the find command. For example `find -name *Talk.txt -exec rm {} ';'`{{execute}}. The braces are used so that the command is executed individually for each result returned by the `find`.
It should be noted that the `-ok` option is the same as `-exec` but asks if you really want to perform the command.
Another option we have when searching for time markers is the `-ctime` option.
The `-size` option makes it easy to search by size and we have three options (also for time stamps) n, +n or -n, e.g. `find -size +0`{{execute}} will search for all files that are larger than 0 bytes.
